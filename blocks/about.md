# 👋 Hi, I'm Rajesh

I'm a **DevOps Engineer**, **Python Developer**, and **Open-Source Contributor** passionate about cloud-native automation, reproducible infrastructure, and improving developer experience.

I love building internal tools, crafting streamlined setups for engineers, and experimenting with infrastructure on real hardware.

## 🏠 Homelab Adventures

I self-host a **Kubernetes cluster using k3s** on a Lenovo Legion Y540. The cluster is managed end-to-end using **FluxCD (GitOps)** and runs a variety of services like Mealie, Linkding, and Vault — with **Traefik** as the ingress controller and **External Secrets Operator** for syncing secrets from Vault.

The homelab is fully declarative and managed through GitOps workflows. It’s documented using **MkDocs** and serves as both a personal learning environment and a testing ground for production-grade infrastructure patterns.

## ⚙️ Dotfiles & System Bootstrapper

I maintain a **cross-platform dotfiles and bootstrapping toolkit** designed to provision bare metal machines, WSL, and dev containers with minimal effort.

It combines:

- 🛠️ **Ansible** for OS-level package installation
- 📦 **mise-en-place** for runtime and developer tool management
- 🧩 **chezmoi** for templated dotfile application
- 🧪 A strict Bash bootstrapper that auto-detects environment and applies everything idempotently

## 🛠️ What I Work On

- Automating workflows with **GitHub Actions**, **Terraform**, and **Ansible**
- Developing Python-based tools and publishing packages to **PyPI**
- Running secure, self-hosted services using **Vault**, **Cloudflared**, and GitOps
- Creating documentation using **MkDocs**, **Astro**, and custom site generators

## 🧠 Learn in Public

I believe in **learning in public**, writing great documentation, and making DevOps workflows accessible and reusable.
